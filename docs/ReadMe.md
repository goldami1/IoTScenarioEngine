Brief project description:
==========================
Scenario Engine project intended to solve the hassle of numerous smart devices assigned to a smart home or a user.
Usually each smart device (i.e. Apple watch, vacuum robot, smart tv, AC, etc...) comes with its application or a Web GUI to
schedule and control its functionality.
However, when it comes to a situation which user has multiple smart devices, the overall control becomes clumsy and uncomfortable.
That's because each one of those IoT devices has its own GUI.
In most cases, user isn't provided with application that provides control for all his smart belongings.
This is where we get into the picture - our project intend to provide both the vendor side and the customer side with
a uniform platform for IoT devices control.
All controlled similarly and easily from same point, same interface, allowing the user to manage scenarios based on all of his smart belongings.

For example: you want to be able to schedule a meeting with friends in your home, attend an appointment with your boss, have your laundry
washed, vacuum your living room and cool down the room prior meeting with your friends. Oh, and the cookies in the oven - you better don't forget to warm them up.
Seems impossible for just one person. BUT IT IS.
If your oven, washing machine, IRobot, and the air conditioner are connected to our Scenario Engine - you can create:
* A scenario that figures out from your calendar you hangout with friends later this evening - cause the IRobot to clean the room before your friends arrive, turns on the air conditioner to your preferred temperature and turns on the oven to heat up the food you prepared there for later.
* A scenario that allows you to schedule a washing machine working time.
